        Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. You can do
        anything your heart can imagine. Don't forget to tell these special
        people in your life just how special they are to you. If these lines
        aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting
        and get your floor wet.
        <br />
        <br />
        We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and
        get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to
        get you addicted.
